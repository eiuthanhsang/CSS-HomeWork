<p id="paragraph">The National Coaching Resource was released in October 2017, and is part of Basketball Australia’s ongoing commitment to supporting coaches at all levels of the sport. Whether coaching a Aussie Hoops program or Basketball Australia’s National Performance Program (NPP), the National Coaching Resource offers practical guidelines to coaches that will give them confidence that the information they’re teaching their players is setting them on the path to represent the green and gold.
